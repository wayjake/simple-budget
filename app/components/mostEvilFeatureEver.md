# Most Evil Feature Ever.

What does it do? No one will ever know. Because I forgot what it was...

Aside from automatically reconsiling your books like any good 'ole AI should be able to do, this goes one step further by being completely free. All files belong to you just like in the good old days. You can choose to host your data with us for free (up to 10mb uploaded) or paste a link to your own cloud server (or closet server, we see you, Steve). Wherever you keep it, we promise, it's yours.

## The Feature!

Anyway, back to this great freaking feature. I wish I knew what it was. Walk me through what we we're thinking...

Well, we were passing callbacks around in the land of React Js and I realized that I needed a simple state machine to hold onto some local state. I basically want to know which items from our state have been processed. So I was going to render off an Atom that didn't include items that were migrated.

It sounds simple, but in reality it's quite the giant freaking hurdle for this ADHD monkey mind to pin together in real time. The art of programming is knowing 80% of what the final product looks like. I don't think I've hit 42%, even, yet.

## The Future!

To be honest, I just wanted to say that. It sounds cool. I mean, the "to be honest" part. That was a phrase stuck in my head today.

Essentially you don't ever need to clarify that you're being honest. But we still feel the need to even when we **are**. Strange conundrums all around us. I just wish I knew what that feature was. For now I feel like I have a half baked "Claymation" film.
